These two writing systems are a bit like the Japanese \"Alphabets\". Each sound has two scripts, either in Hiragana for Japanese words (if Kanji is not used) or in Katakana for words of foreign origin.\n\nIn these two writing systems there are many characters but the most used are 104: the \"Gojuon\" (46 single characters), the \"Dakuon\" (20 characters) and \"Handakuon\" (5 characters) derived from characters simple, and finally the \"Yoon\" (33 characters) composed of two single characters.\n\nTo learn Kana there is no secret, you have to learn them by heart!";
