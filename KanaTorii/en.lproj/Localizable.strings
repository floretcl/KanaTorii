These two writing systems are a bit like the Japanese \"Alphabets\". Each sound has two writings, either in Hiragana for Japanese words (if you don't use Kanji) or in Katakana for words of foreign origin.\n\nIn these two writing systems there are many characters but for the most used, there are 104: the \"Gojuons\" (46 simple characters), the \"Dakuons\" (20 characters) and the \"Handakuons\" (5 characters) derived from simple characters, and finally the \"Yoon\" (33 characters) composed of two simple characters.\n\nTo learn the Kanas there is no secret, you have to learn them by heart!";
